        <h1>Preparing to Breastfeed</h1>
    </header>

        <section>
            <h2>Before the Birth</h2>
            <p>It's good to find out as much as you can about breastfeeding before you have your baby. It may help you feel more confident when you start breastfeeding your baby.</p>
            <p>Antenatal classes usually cover important aspects of breastfeeding, such as positioning and attachment, expressing, and tackling common problems.</p>
            <p>You can also learn from your midwife, family, friends, or helpful websites.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Skin-to-Skin Contact</h2>
            <p>Skin-to-skin contact with your baby right after birth helps keep them warm, calm, and steady their breathing. It's also a great time for your first breastfeed. Your midwife can help with positioning and attachment.</p>
            <p>If your baby is delivered by caesarean, skin-to-skin contact is still possible right after delivery.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Colostrum: Your First Milk</h2>
            <p>The thick, golden-yellow fluid your breasts produce after birth is called colostrum. It's concentrated, so your baby will only need small amounts initially.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Let-Down Reflex</h2>
            <p>Your baby's sucking triggers the let-down reflex, causing milk to flow. You might feel a tingling sensation, but this varies. Your baby will switch from quick sucks to deep swallows as milk flows.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How Often to Feed</h2>
            <p>In the first week, your baby may feed often, possibly every hour. Over time, feeds become less frequent but longer. Feed your baby as often as they want, even at night, to help build your milk supply.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Leaking Breasts</h2>
            <p>Leaking milk is normal. Wearing breast pads and expressing milk can help. If you're uncomfortable, try offering your baby a feed.</p>
